### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

> - ðŸ”­ I started programming at the age of 15 with programming logic, and after that I tried to evolve little by little.

```javascript
  class Daniel {
    public contacts() {
      return {
        github: '@danieljuniorce',
        instagram: 'https://instagram.com/danieljuniorce',
        discord: 'danieljuniorce#6729',
        telegram: 'danieljuniorce',
        linkedin: 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-souza-477a83a4/'
      }
    }
    
    public info() {
      return {
        name: 'Daniel',
        surname: 'Souza',
        yearsOld: '23',
        country: 'Brazil',
        state: 'CearÃ¡',
        city: 'Fortaleza'
      }
    }
  }
  
  const MyInfo = new Daniel()
  
  MyInfo.info()
  MyInfo.contacts()
```
